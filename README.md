#  ReadersChat - AI-Powered Document Q&A

ReadersChat is an intelligent chatbot application that allows you to upload text documents and ask questions about their content using AI. Built with Streamlit and LangChain, it uses OpenAI's GPT models and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide accurate, context-aware answers.

##  Features

- **Document Upload**: Upload any `.txt` file to analyze
- **Smart Q&A**: Ask questions and get accurate answers based on document content
- **Conversation Memory**: Chatbot remembers previous exchanges for contextual follow-up questions
- **Source Citations**: View relevant document excerpts that support each answer
- **Clean Interface**: Simple, intuitive Streamlit-based UI

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OpokuFrimpong/ReadersChat.git
   cd ReadersChat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   ```
   
   **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to GitHub!

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8502`
